This repository contains the code and resources for the Mecatron software training workshop. It's a comprehensive ROS 2 workspace designed to teach robotics software development fundamentals using ROS 2 Humble and ament_cmake build system.

## Repository Structure

The workspace contains several key packages:
- **workshop_interfaces** - Custom message and service definitions for inter-node communication
- **workshop_main** - Core implementation packages with example nodes and applications

## Getting Started

This workspace is organized for hands-on training and demonstration purposes, helping participants learn and practice robotics software development using modern ROS 2 practices and ament_cmake build tools.

## Build System

The workspace uses the standard ROS 2 colcon build system with properly configured build, install, and log directories for a complete development environment.
